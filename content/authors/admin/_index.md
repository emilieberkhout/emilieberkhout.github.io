I am a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam and a researcher at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development (AIGHD). In my current research I study the impacts of education policy reforms on learning outcomes in Indonesia, as part of the {{< staticref "https://riseprogramme.org/" "newtab" >}}Research on Improving Systems of Education (RISE) program{{< /staticref >}}.

Previously, I also worked on impact evaluations of interventions in early child development, food security and water and sanitation in Asia and Africa.
